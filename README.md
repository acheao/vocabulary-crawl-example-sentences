# word-crawl-example-sentences
## About
When I studing a new English vocabulary, I'm search some simple example sentences in the Oxford Dictionary and record them for review. However, I'm found that was cast a lots of time to record the example sentences manually. So I wanted to use a python crawler to grab example sentences based on the words I typed. This is the project does.
